# Anita's Kitchen Groove

A responsive, multi-page website that aims to showcase and promote a local, home-based food business, called "Anita's Kitchen Groove". The overall feel of the website aims to capture the passion the business owner has for producing homemade food, that is delicious and nourishing and always made with love. 

## UX

While Anita's Kitchen Groove website is for existing clients, it also aims to reach a broader audience by targeting both the immediate community, in which the business is based (Derbyshire, East Midlands) as well as surrounding communities in the U.K. 

Although not directly advertised as such, the products available do have connections to South African culture, which offers the business a niche audience in this respect, i.e. South Africans living in the U.K. who seek out products that remind them of home.

Up until now, the business owner has promoted their products and taken orders from cliets, via social media platforms, most notably Facebook. For this reason, the primary purpose of the website is to consolidate and strengthen the idealogy of the business, and to promote it to new and potential customers through means of an enjoyable online experience.
