# Anita's Kitchen Groove

A responsive, multi-page website that aims to showcase and promote a local, home-based food business, called "Anita's Kitchen Groove". The overall feel of the website aims to capture the passion the business owner has for producing homemade food, that is delicious and nourishing and always made with love.

## UX

While Anita's Kitchen Groove website is for existing clients, it also aims to reach a broader audience by targeting the immediate community, in which the business is based (Derbyshire, East Midlands) as well as surrounding communities in the U.K.

Although not directly advertised as such, the products available do have connections to South African culture, which offers the business a niche audience in this respect, i.e. South Africans living in the U.K. who seek out products that remind them of home.

##

### 1. Strategy

Up until now, the business owner has promoted the business and dealt with orders via social media platforms, most notably Facebook. For this reason, the primary purpose of the website is to consolidate and strengthen the idealogy of the business, and to promote it to new and potential customers through means of an enjoyable online experience.

### 2. Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** for the website will include:

- a home page - with attractive images showcasing the brand and products.
- an about page - giving a 'personalised' view into the history of the business and the owner.
- a gallery page - further showcasing of products through beautiful images.
- a menu - so that users can clearly see what's available to order with all relevant info included, eg. product ingredients, pricing etc.
- a contact page - with a form, that will allow users to send an email directly to the business owner to place orders or ask any questions.

**Desirable features** at a later stage may include:

- a newsletter sign up feature
- a page for recipes/cooking videos
- an online payment feature

### 3. Structure

**Stakeholder interview:**

1. What are the goals, values and vision of your business?
   To create a sustainable and thriving business, using quality products that will showcase the individuality of my baking.

2. Who are your users (customers)? And how will this website help them?
   Young and old alike. The website will allow the business to be visible on platforms other than social media.

3. What are your unique selling points?
   My packaging, attention to detail and customer service, are unlike others. Each package is unique to the customers request.

4. Who are your competitors? What do you like or dislike about them?
   There are several companies that sell the same products throughout the UK. I appreciate their ability to get more exposure and sales due to the fact that they have a diverse array of South African products that clients can access all in one shop.
